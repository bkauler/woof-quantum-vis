Note that there will be lots of hidden folders in rox.sourceforge.net/OpenWith
These are generated by script usr/sbin/build-rox-sendto by 3buildeasydistro in woofQ.
Also should be done when a pkg installed or uninstalled.

interesting discussion: http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=116952
If a /etc/xdg/rox.sourceforge.net/MIME-types/text_* does not exist, rox will fallback
to /etc/xdg/rox.sourceforge.net/MIME-types/text
So only need to have a specific one, say text_html, when want a app other than "defaulttexteditor'.

MochiMoppel reported that rox right-click "Open as text" uses mimetype text_plain.
