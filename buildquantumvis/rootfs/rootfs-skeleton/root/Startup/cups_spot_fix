#20221229 cupsd tries to run utilities in /usr/libexec/cups/filter/ as user spot
# but fails, see /var/log/cups/error_log. this is due to fscrypt and kernel keys.
# when we run an app non-root, the startup script (ex: /usr/bin/firefox) makes
# fscrypt work in that user. however, for cupsd, it switches into spot without
# that fix. this little hack fixes...
