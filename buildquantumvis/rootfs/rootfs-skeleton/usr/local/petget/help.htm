            <h1>PKGget Package Manager (PPM)</h1>
            <p>
              A "package" is Linux terminology for an application. These
              are held in
              online repositories, and you can download and install any
              package.</p>
            <p>PKGget is a descendent of the Puppy Package Manager,
              which is also known by the acronym "PPM". The difference
              is that PKGget is a later generation, with more features.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Repository and category selection<br>
            </h3>
            <p>
              You click a radio-button along the top to choose the
              desired repository
              -- usually the left-most is the one most suitable for your
              current
              version of EasyOS.</p>
            <p>The radio-buttons aligned vertically on the left enable
              you to narrow the display to a specific category (these
              notes are for the 'Classic' user interface, 'Ziggy' UI has
              slightly different layout).</p>
            <p>Notice the checkboxes labeled "EXE" and "DEV" (and on
              some versions of PKGget also "DOC" and "NLS"). Many
              packages are split into smaller packages, as follows:</p>
            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top">EXE<br>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">This is the actual application, you
                    definitely want this.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top">DEV<br>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">This contains development files, only
                    of interest to those into compiling source code.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Most packages have documentation and translation-files
              builtin, not as separate packages. It depends on the
              package repository; Void Linux packages, for example, are
              split into two, the main package and a "-devel" package. <br>
            </p>
            <p>An example is "libwv-1.2.3.x86_64.xbps" and
              "libwv-devel-1.2.3.x86_64.xbps". If the "EXE" checkbox is
              ticked, then only the first package will show in PKGget.
              Ditto for "DEV". Or, tick both checkboxes to show both
              packages.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>How to install and uninstall a package<br>
            </h3>
            <p>When you click on one of the packages displayed in the
              big window,
              another window pops up asking if you really want to
              install the
              package, and also offers further information about the
              package -- so
              you can learn more about it before deciding whether to
              install it.</p>
            <p>When a package is installed, it appears in the window
              bottom-right.</p>
            <p>
              To uninstall a package, simply click on it. There will be
              another window asking you to confirm deletion.</p>
            <h3>Package repositories</h3>
            <p>As mentioned above, radiobuttons along the top enable
              selection of a repository.</p>
            <p>Usually, these will be whatever "compatible distribution"
              has been used to build EasyOS, as well as one or more PET
              repositories.</p>
            <p>For example, the Kirkstone-series of EasyOS; the packages
              were compiled in OpenEmbedded, and the resulting binary
              packages used to build EasyOS. All of the packages
              compiled in OpenEmbedded are uploaded to the Internet and
              provided as a package repository. You will see a
              radiobutton labeled "oe-kirkstone"</p>
            <p>Another example is EasyOS built with Void Linux packages.
              In that case, you will see radiobuttons "void-current" and
              "void-current-nonfree".<br>
            </p>
            <p>There are various PET repositories. PETs are the Puppy
              format for packages, an acronym that we humourously say
              stands for <span style="font-style: italic;">Puppy Extra
                Treats</span>. Those on offer will depend on which
              EasyOS-series you are using, but usually there will be
              "pet-noarch" and another such as "pet-kirkstone" or
              "pet-void".</p>
            <p>"pet-noarch" are not binary packages. That is, they do
              not contain binary executables that require a specific CPU
              architecture such as x86_64 or aarch64. These packages
              will run on any CPU.</p>
            <p>"pet-kirkstone" and "pet-void" are binary packages.<br>
            </p>
            <p>PKGget is a chameleon, able to install packages from
              almost any repository. Though, for compatibility, you
              would normally only install from those shown in the
              repository radiobuttons. <br>
            </p>
            <p>For your information, the packages of different Linux
              distributions may be identified by the filename extension:</p>
            <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top">Debian, Ubuntu<br>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">".deb"<br>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top">Slackware<br>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">".tgz" or ".txz"<br>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                  <td valign="top">".pkg.tar.xz" or ".pkg.tar.zst"<br>

                  <td valign="top">".xbps"<br>
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td valign="top">PET<br>
                  </td>
                  <td valign="top">".pet"<br>
                  </td>

              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>PKGget is capable of installing any of these. You can
              actually install any foreign package; for example download
              a ".deb" package, click on it and choose to install. But
              of course, you need to be careful about this, as a foreign
              package may not be compatible.</p>
            <h3>Searching</h3>
            <p>
              The "Find:" box enables you to search for any package.</p>
            <p>You can type in a partial name, but a match is only found
              from the
              left. For example, if you do a search for "pan" you might
              find this:</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <pre>pango-1.28.1-w5 Library for layout and rendering of internationalized text<br>pangomm-2.26.2-w5 oo wrapper for pango library<br>panoramixproto-1.1-w5 Panoramix extension headers</pre>
              <p> </p>
            </div>
            <p>But doing a search on "mm" yields nothing, as there are
              no package names starting with "mm".</p>
            <p>However, the Find box will accept '*' wildcards; what is
              referred to as
              "glob wildcards". So, type in "*mm" will find all packages
              with "mm" in
              their names.</p>
            <p>You can even have multiple wildcards, for example
              "p*mix*to", which will find the 'panoramixproto' package.</p>
            <p>The search is case-insensitive, so a search for "PAN"
              will give the same results as shown above.</p>
            <p>PKGget also supports searching for multiple keywords.
              Also, the Description field is searched as well as the
              package name. For example, it you type into the
              search-box, "abiword plugins", it will find packages with
              these two words, either in the package name or the
              description.</p>
            <p>One thing to note about the search is that it searches
              the entire
              repository (or repositories), and ignores the vertical
              Category radiobuttons on the left
              side.</p>
            <h3>Installing without the PKGget GUI</h3>
            <p>Already mentioned this above; the example given of
              download a .deb package.<br>
            </p>
            <p>You can actually download any package, from anywhere, and
              install it.
              All that you have to do is click on the package in the
              file-manager
              window, and the package-installer component of PKGget will
              run and install
              the package. This works for all types of packages,
              including PETs,
              Ubuntu/Debian DEBs, Slackware, Arch and Void packages.</p>
            <p>Note however, if you install an individual package in
              this way, without
              going through the PKGget GUI interface, any dependencies
              are not
              installed, and you will have to take care of that
              yourself.</p>
            <p>One good thing, a package installed in this way will show
              up in the PKGget
              GUI "Installed-packages" window and it can thus be
              uninstalled.</p>
            <h3>How to update EasyOS to next version</h3>
            <p>
              Awhile ago, someone criticised PPM, stating that it did
              not allow a complete upgrade of Puppy (or EasyOS) to the
              next version. The package managers in some distributions
              allow you to install all packages required to completely
              update to the latest version of the distro.</p>
            <p>PPM does not offer that, because Puppy (and EasyOS) does
              not work that way. It is outside the ambit, or we could
              say the "contract" of what PPM is required to do.<br>
            </p>
            <p>In EasyOS, the usual way to do a version update is to
              click on the "update" icon on the desktop. Read more here:
