    <h1>First documentation post, shellCMS<br>
</h1>
    <p>This is an installation of shellCMS, for documentation posts. 
Documentation posts differ from blog posts, as they are filed by 
category, whereas blog/news posts are filed by date.<br>
</p>
<p>This raw post is filed locally at <tt>~/.shellcms/www/admin/first-documentation-post-shellcms.htmraw</tt>, and the generated post (with header, footer, layout, etc.) is at <tt>~/.shellcms/www/admin/first-documentation-post-shellcms.html</tt>. It is filed under category "admin".<br>
</p>
<p>To find out about blog posts, click on "news" link above.<br>
</p>
<p>Images may be inserted in posts. All posts have an <tt>images</tt> folder, in this case <tt>~/.shellcms/www/admin/images</tt>, so just specify a relative path, for example <tt>images/fido96.png</tt>:<br>
</p>
<p><img src="images/fido96.png" alt="test-image" width="96" height="96"></p>
<p>When creating or editing a post, do not worry about layout. Header, 
footer and layout are taken care of when the post is "posted", that is, 
the final <tt>first-documentation-post-shellcms.html</tt> file. For example, if you insert a table into this post, no need to set the width, for example:<br>
</p>
<table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">First cell of table. Not bothering about width, as it will be taken care of after posting.<br>
      </td>
      <td valign="top">Second cell of table. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Read the test post in the blog ("News" link above) for a bit more info. 
Also, there is a website for shellCMS, with documentation:<br>

</p>
<p>Have fun, shellCMS is super easy to use!
