            </h1>
            <p>shellCMS is a static site generator Content Management
              System. Features include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Scales efficiently to large site</li>
              <li>Completely static HTML pages</li>
              <li>Create and edit pages with WYSIWYG HTML editor</li>
              <li>Any number of shellCMS installations on same site</li>
              <li>Documentation and blog modes</li>
              <li>shellCMS is a small bash shell script</li>
              <li>Develop locally, upload with rsync</li>
              <li>Extremely easy to use</li>
              <li>Optional Disqus and Twitter blog comments<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not be hassled with the limitations and gotchas of
              markdown. Use a What You See Is What You Get HTML editor,
              very easy to use. shellCMS is especially setup to use
              SeaMonkey Composer (part of the SeaMonkey browser suite).</p>
            <p>shellCMS has a "MODE" variable, that is set to either
              "document" or "blog". This optimizes it for either of
              these purposes. <br>
              You can have two installations, one set to "document" the
              other to "blog". "shellcms.tar.gz" comes configured like
              this, with the document-mode shellCMS at the top-level of
              the site, the blog in "news" folder.<br>
              But, very easy to rearrange any other way.</p>
            <p>Advantages of a static site:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Very secure</li>
              <li>Very low server load</li>
              <li>Very fast page loading</li>
              <li>Site "already archived'<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As there is no database, your site is "already archived",
              on your local PC. You can very easily move to another
              remote host, just upload the files to it.</p>
            <p>To see the speed, go to the Google speed test page, test
              "http://bkhome.org":</p>

            <p>Of course, bkhome.org is run by shellCMS!</p>
            <h3>Requirements:</h3>
            <p>Any operating system that can run bash. Almost all Linux
              distributions come with bash preinstalled. Maybe Mac also,
              but not tested. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Windows users, you have my condolences. However, it is
              easy to boot up a Linux distribution from a USB Flash
              drive. I recommend Puppy Linux or Easy Linux. Easy, and
              most releases of Puppy, have SeaMonkey pre-installed.</p>
            <p>News posts about Easy Linux are here:</p>

            <p>There are other WYSIWYG HTML editors, or if you wish, use
              a text editor.<br>
