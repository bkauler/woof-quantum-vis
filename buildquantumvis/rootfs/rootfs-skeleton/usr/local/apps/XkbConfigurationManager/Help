Xkb Configuration Manager
-------------------------
Originally written by Dougal. Later changes by rodin and BK.

Traditionally, the Xorg keyboard configuration settings were in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf. However, recent Linux distributions may have moved that information into a file in directory /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d.
Quirky Linux 8.1.4+ (a fork of Puppy Linux), has the keyboard information in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev-puppy.conf.

+++++ Keyboard Model +++++
The keyboard model is just that -- you might have a special "brand-name" keyboard, or a "generic" keyboard, labled "pc".

Note that most people (using a pc, not a laptop) are likely to have a "pc104" or "pc105" -- the number being the number of keys (count 'em!).

Puppy uses "pc102" by default, so you might want to change yours.


+++++ Layouts +++++
This is the "country" part. You can have more than one, for typing in more than one language.

If you select more than one layout, you will want to go to the "Options" section and select one of the options in the "Group Shift/Lock behaviour" dialog -- to enable you to switch between layout.
You might also want to select a "Use keyboard LED..." option, so that one of the LEDs on your keyboard lights up when you're using an alternate mode.


+++++ Layout Variants +++++
These enable further tuning of your keyboard type. 
The "Layouts" section only gives you the country -- here you can select which exactly of the layouts used in that country you want.

Note that selecting a variant is NOT mandatory, it is just to further tweak the layout.


########## Options ##########

+++++ Group Shift/Lock behavior +++++
Here you select a key/key-combination to press in order to switch between keyboard layouts.


+++++ Third level choosers +++++
Just like the "Shift" key enables you to use a "second level" with each key, you can also select a key to use a "third level" on your keys, to enable more functions.

The best example for this is the Eurosign (below), which can be assigned to a key and typed by pressing it along with your "third level chooser".


+++++ Control key position +++++
This enables you to select which key would be used as "Ctrl". Good if you are using a keyboard that's different to which you're used to or (??) with a laptop.


+++++ Use keyboard LED to show alternative group +++++
Your keyboard has three LEDs on it, titled Num Lock, Caps Lock and Scroll Lock.
If you use more than one keyboard layout, you can set of these LEDs to be turned on/off whenever you switch layout, so you know which layout you're using.


+++++ CapsLock key behavior +++++
Here you can select exactly what your Caps Lock does (and the effect of the Shift key on it).


+++++ Alt/Win key behavior +++++



+++++ Compose key position +++++


+++++ Adding the EuroSign to certain keys +++++
Select which key the Eurosign will be assigned to.
Requires a "third level chooser" to be used.
