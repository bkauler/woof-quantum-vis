#+a list of possible settings for one of the xkb Options.
# The list is for use with Xdialog. It is space delimited
#+with the first field of the original list used as tag and
#+the second being quoted.
#
# It is invoked with two numbers: line # the header of our
#+section is at and line # the next section header is at.
# 
# The last section of the FILE can be processed if the second
#+number given is the number of lines in FILE (wc -l $FILE)+2.
#+(however, since it has subsections it will have to be broken
#+down by hand, so it might be easier to handle it differently
#+from the beginning...
