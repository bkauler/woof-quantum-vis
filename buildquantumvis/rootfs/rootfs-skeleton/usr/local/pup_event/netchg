#190215 first release.
#190805 may have nm-connection-editor (in network-manager-applet pkg) instead of nmtui (in network-manager pkg).
#190922 BK: 190805: now "nm-setup" in defaultconnect.
#200521 pup_event_frontend_d modified to call here less often.
#200521 rerwin has reported eth cable active but networkmanager has failed to obtain a lease.
#200521 pup_event_frontend_d now passes 20=carrier-up, 21=carrier-down, 17=plug and unplug usb wifi dongle.
#200609 Use pgprs 2.0 interface.
