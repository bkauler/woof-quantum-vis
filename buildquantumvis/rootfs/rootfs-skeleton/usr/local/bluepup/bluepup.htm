            <h1>BluePup Bluetooth manager</h1>
            BluePup is a GUI wrapper around the commandline
            'bluetoothctl' utility, which is part of the 'bluez'
            package.<br>
            <h2>GUI window</h2>
            In the 'Command' box, any command that bluetoothctl accepts
            can be entered, and the result displayed in 'Output log'.
            <br>
<br>
However, you will likely not need to type in commands, as clicking the 
buttons to 'SCAN' and 'REGISTER' are simple 
operations that will work in the majority of cases.<br>
            <br>
            If any new devices are detected, they are composed into 'Found
            devices', which is a list from which the user can make a
            choice.
            <br>
            <br>A device that has been successfully paired goes into the
 'Registered devices' list. It will still need to be connected to be 
used. An orange tick indicates paired, a green tick indicates connected.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, a device that has been once connected, will do so 
automatically in the future, if turned on prior to bootup, or afterward.<br>
<h2>Agent</h2>
The agent is a daemon that is used to negotiate with the remote device 
during pairing. It may require that a PIN number be entered or confirmed
 on the remote device. BluePup will display the required PIN in some 
cases, such as for a keyboard. <br>
<br>
            <h2>BluePup tray applet</h2>
            Currently only indicates whether Bluetooth 'bluetoothd'
            daemon is running or not, and clicking on icon launches the
            BluePup GUI.<br>
