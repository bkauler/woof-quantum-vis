These are icons for the desktop (currently managed by ROX-Filer) and
for the top-level of the menu (default is JWM).
The desktop icons are 48x48, menu are 24x24 (although JWM will scale bigger
icons to fit).

The currently selected set of icons are in /usr/local/lib/X11/pixmaps.

/usr/local/lib/X11/themes is intended as a repository for different icon
themes. The names may match the GTK themes at /usr/share/themes.

'FlatOrange' is a set of SVG icons, set to match the 'Citrus-cut' GTK
theme. However, these SVG icons are designed to be processable by a
script to generate PNG icons of any theme. They were created with four
different colors that can be changed by a script to suit any theme.
The utility 'svg-convert' (part of the librsvg package) can be used to
generate PNG files from the themed SVG files.

Other directories contain ready-to-go themed icons. One of these is
'Stardust' -- note, there is also a matching /usr/share/themes/Stardust.
