"try a very long sentence, keep going, the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog and the cat jumped over the moon, while the little dog ran around the house and jumped on the sofa, while the kitten slept preacefully in the garden bed beside the shed and the flowing wildly stream. Wow that is a long sentence, but let's add even more text, see what the limit is now, have we reached it yet, well I wonder about that, and what the translator will make of this confused text sentence. Amazing, it is handling this, perhaps there is a daily limit that I am hitting, that is truncating the text to 178 characters, which is a puzzle that I do not ZXREDYTRUYT= understand."
