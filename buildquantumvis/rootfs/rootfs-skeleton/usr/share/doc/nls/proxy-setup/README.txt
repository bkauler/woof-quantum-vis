proxy-setup is a gui to set a proxy server.

It is a binary executable, written in BaCon. The executable is at /usr/sbin
and the source code is /usr/sbin/proxy-setup.bac and compile instructions
/usr/sbin/proxy-setup.pupdev. The latter two are in the 'devx' SFS.

/usr/share/doc/nls/proxy-setup/proxy-setup.pot is also in the 'devx'.

MoManager, the Translation manager, reads the .pot file.
