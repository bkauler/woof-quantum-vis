     QV is a "new paradigm" for an Operating System, a blend of the best ideas from EasyOS, Puppy Linux and Quirky Linux, and a fundamental rethink of security, maintainability and ease-of-use. <br>
     <br>
     Reading this for the first time, you want a quick overview, to grasp the basic ideas behind QV, what is special, practical usage, and why should you even bother to switch from the OS you are currently using? <br>
     <h2>The desktop</h2>
     Firstly, the desktop. It looks pretty much like any desktop, a bit retro, but we consider that to be a good thing. Rather than lengthy explanations, the best way to discover what the desktop can offer you, is just to explore. Have fun, poke around in the menu, click the icons in the tray, mouse-over will also pop-up useful information. <br>
     <br>
     Here is a snapshot of the desktop with brief comments to get you started: <br>
     
 <img src="images/desktop1.png" alt="desktop1" width="640" height="480"> 
<!--     <div style="position:relative;width:640px;height:480px;background:url(images/desktop1.png);background-repeat: no-repeat;">

         Click to mount, click "close-box" to unmount.

     In these example pictures, QV is installed on a USB Flash drive, that identifies itself as sdb. There are two partitions, sdb1 is the <i>boot</i> partition, and sdb2 is the <i>working</i> partition. Note the orange rectangle -- this means sdb2 is mounted and cannot be unmounted. <br>
     Drive sda is an internal drive, and sda2 is mounted, and can be unmounted by clicking on the "x". <br>
     Try for yourself: click any partition, and it will mount and the file manager will open. <br>
     <br>
     Using QV is easy; however, to discover the hidden power, it is necessary to have some appreciation of what is going on underneath... <br>
     <h2>How QV works</h2>
     It has already been stated that sdb1 is the boot-partition in the above pictures. That contains the Limine boot loader, which is the very first menu you see at power-on. The boot loader is responsible for loading the Linux kernel and the first stage of the Linux operating system. The kernel is named "vmlinuz", the first-stage file is "initrd"; they are in the boot-partition. The QV operating system is in sdb2, the working-partition.<br>
     <br>
     After bootup, if you open the file manager, and look at "/", the top-level of the directories, this is what you see: looks as you would expect, yes?<br>
     <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td valign="top"><img src="images/top-of-rootfs.png" alt="top-of-layers" width="608" height="314"><br>
        </td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>
     <br>
     However, if you look in sdb2, the working-partition, this is what you see:<br>
     <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td valign="top">
         <img src="images/working-partition-top.png" alt="working-partition-top"><br>
        </td>
        <td valign="top"><img src="images/working-partition-down.png" alt="working-partition"><br>
        </td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>
     What are those folders for, and whereabouts is "/"?
     <br><br>
     Some hints as to what those folders do: <br>
     <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="100%">
      <tbody>
       <tr>
        <td valign="top"><b>data</b>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">For anything. AppImages and Flatpaks install here. Build area for woofQV.
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td valign="top"><b>files</b>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">Folder where you keep all your own files, such as photos, downloads, documents. Optionally encrypted.
        </td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
        <td valign="top"><b>home</b>
        </td>
        <td valign="top">Each app may run as its own user; home folders are in here. Optionally encrypted.
        </td>
       </tr>
      </tbody>
     </table>
     <br>
     The quick answer to whereabouts of that "/", is that it is in a btrfs subvolume inside the working-partition. Which might be a meaningless explanation! In which case, read this online web page:<br>
