[general]
#this "script_strings" SSS domain is intended for any scripts that need translation.
#the SSS technique translates files "in place", meaning that the original file gets replaced by the
#translated file (menu_strings domain is slightly different, in that it first generates English files from
#templates, then translates them). Thus the files are translated *before* execution, whereas the gettext
#and t12s methods are run-time translations.
#the translations in this SSS-domain, that is, this file script_strings*, are performed by /usr/sbin/fixscripts, which
#in turn is called from quicksetup (chooselocale) whenever locale is changed, also by rc.update whenever a version upgrade.
#the section-ids are a full path, for example _etc_rc.d_functions4puppy4 means /etc/rc.d/functions4puppy4
# ...fixscripts will accept any substitution for the '/' char, ex XetcXrc.dXfunctions4puppy4
#Please type translation only between the last two % characters. For example: s%"done"%"fertig"%
#Keep all formatting exactly the same, that is retain all " ' < > / \ characters.
# -- do not replace the " and ' with left-side or right-side quote characters.
#Keep all variables as-is, exs: ${DROPOUT} $DROPOUT -- do not translate!
