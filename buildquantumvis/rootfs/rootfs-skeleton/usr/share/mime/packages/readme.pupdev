in woofQ, these .xml mime files are in the package
'shared-mime-info', and puppy-specific add-ons are
in packages-templates/shared-mime-info

The template FIXUPHACK script will run 'update-mime-database'
when the package is being composed by '2createpackages'.

In a running puppy, these files are in the "devx" pet, also the
executable 'update-mime-database'.
