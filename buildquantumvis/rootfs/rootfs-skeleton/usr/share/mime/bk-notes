--------
placed image/png.xml, jpeg.xml in rootfs-skeleton in woofQ.
this folder will be filled when 'devx' loaded, however,
Scribus desktop publisher outputs an error if png.xml isn't there
(but still seems to work ok).
Threw in jpeg.xml

Note, still using an old 'shared-mime-info' package in EasyOS 2.3.2:
woofq: woof-project/pet-construction/amd64/pet_packages-buster/shared-mime-info-0.90-r1-pyro64
I posted about this years ago: later versions were mistaking some text files for
octet-stream files, which was very annoying.

Today I want to add mime handling for zstd files. 

woofq: woof-project/easyos/easy-code/rootfs-skeleton/usr/share/mime/packages/puppy.xml
has some special mime-types, and could add it there.

ref: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/zstd
have created rootfs-skeleton/usr/share/mime/packages/zstd.xml

Note: probably should take another look at latest 'shared-mime-info'.
