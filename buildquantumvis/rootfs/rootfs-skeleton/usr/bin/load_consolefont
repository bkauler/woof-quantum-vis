#a console font gets loaded in the initrd, or failing that in rc.country.
#i was also loading it in /usr/sbin/quicksetup is locale is changed.
#however, we have problems with it getting "dropped", which seems to happen when run X.
#so, i have created this script that will call whenever we exit from X, such as
#in xwin and in xorgwizard. thanks to L18L for investigating this.
#20230522 now using zap psfu fonts.

##note, en locale will have empty /etc/fontmap...
#[ ! -s /etc/fontmap ] && exit

#FONTMAP="`cat /etc/fontmap`"
