Traditionally, EasyOS login is as the root user. 

Individual apps can be run non-root, each with its own user; for example, 
firefox will run as user "firefox", with home folder /home/firefox

Apps in containers run as "crippled root", which is effectively running like
a non-root user. Alternatively, an app can be run in a container as user "spot".

As from EasyOS 4.5, the boot menu has an entry to flip from login as root to 
zeus user, or vice-versa.

Currently, login as zeus user is still experimental, with some oddities;
though mostly works.

User zeus is a "super user", with almost as much administrative privilege as
the root user. Thus, you can perform most operations in a terminal without
having to append "sudo".
