[ -f bin/bash5.new ] && mv -f bin/bash5.new usr/bin/bash

#bash has 'which' utility, which is broken (i found "which pwd" does not work).
#instead, have script rootfs-skeleton/usr/bin/which
if [ -e usr/bin/which ];then
 rm -f usr/bin/which
fi

#150826 might as well check this:
ln -snf bash usr/bin/sh
