        <h1>HelpSurfer</h1>
HelpSurfer is a simple web page viewer, intended for viewing local HTML 
help files. It supports HTML v4 and some CSS v1 and v2, not Javascript. <br>
        <br>
Dependencies are libgtkhtml-2, gnet, libsystem and gtk+.<br>

        <br>
There was something else that I wanted HelpSurfer to be able to do:
    execute local executables.
    <br>

    This is not a web browser, it is a local help viewer, so I can
    justify doing things that would be unacceptable in a browser.
    <br>

    Although it is not legitimate html, HelpSurfer 0.3 supports
    hyperlinks to
    <br>

    <br>

    <i>"exec:&lt;executable&gt;[ &lt;parameters&gt;]"</i>
    <br>

    <br>

    For example:
    <br>

    <br>

    <i>&lt;a href="exec:leafpad /usr/share/doc/home.htm"&gt;EXECUTE
      LEAFPAD&lt;/a&gt;</i>
    <br>

    <br>

    I have a requirement for this feature. <br>

        <br>
The chap who created Surfer, many years ago created version 0.0.7 which worked with libgtkhtml, forming a very tiny HTML viewer.
        <br>

        <br>
This tiny version has been in many pups (Puppy Linux and derivatives) as the internal HTML documentation viewer.
        <br>

        <br>
Tiny, which is great, very useful just to look at local HTML files, 
but there is one major problem -- libgtkhtml supports HTML4 and some 
CSS, there is no support for javascript.
        <br>
Consequently, web pages on the Internet cannot be reliably displayed, and in many cases will crash Surfer.
        <br>

        <br>
What is needed is for Surfer to treat Internet links in local web 
pages as a special case, and launch "defaultbrowser" (which is the main 
browser, ex SeaMonkey).
        <br>

        <br>
I looked at the source code, and it wasn't obvious how to do that, so I posted the question to the Puppy Forum:

Fantastic, forum member SFR has created a patch!
